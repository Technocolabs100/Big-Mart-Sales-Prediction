Imported Required Libraries :

LoADING dataset :

Data Exploration :
Has checked the Head of the Dataset
Has checked the Size of the Dataset
Has checked the Columns of the Dataset
Has checked the infomation of Datatypes
Has checked the Statics Summary of the Dataset
Has checked the Null values using lambda function

Preprocessing of Dataset
Has checked null values 
Filled the null values using Mean for Numerical value and Mode for categorical values

To check the univariate Distribution of data, have used distplot() function on a different columns of Bigmart Analysis Dataset.

To check the Count of observation in each Categorical bins, have used countplot() function.

To check the quantify the association between variable of dataset, have used coorelation matrics.

One hot Encoding :
To convert categorical variables into a format that can be readily used by machine learning algorithms.

Split the item :

Model Training :
Dataset, which is used to train the ML algorithms

importing supervised Machine learning algorithms to check the Means Squared erorr and CV.

Summary of the project :
We built a predictive odel using the sales data of 1559 products across 10 store in different cities. Our aim was to predict the sales of each product at a particular store and understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales. We used various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision tree regression, and random forest regression to build the predictive model.
  We also deal with the missing values in the data by imputing them using various techniqus such as mean, median and mode. After training and testing our model, we found that the random forest regression algorithms performed the best with an accracy score of 0.29
   Based on our analysis, we identified that the properties of products that played a key role in increasing sales were their weight, visibility and type. on the other hand, the properties of stores that had a significnt impact on sales were thier size and location.

   Overall, this project helped us to gain insights into the sales patterns of Bigmart's productsacross different stores and provided.
